Multiple variants and metrics, simultaneous conflicting experiments, and improper randomization will complicate experiments. Most people do not have a formal academic background on experimental design.\n",

Advanced concepts to know that may impress interviewers includes alternatives to A/B testing (such as multi-armed bandit strategies), or alternatives to t-tests and z-tests (e.g. non-parametric methods, boot-strapping)."

    "[**Analysis of variance (ANOVA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance): In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups. ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance. It is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample t-tests, but is more conservative (results in less type I error) and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.\n",
    "- [**Fixed effects models**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model) apply to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole. They represent the observed quantities in terms of explanatory variables that are treated as if the quantities were non-random.\n",
    "- [**Random effects models**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_effects_model) are used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are random variables, some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model. They assume that the data being analysed is drawn from a hierarchy of different populations whose differences relate to that hierarchy.\n",
    "- [**Mixed models**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model) contain experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types. They are particularly useful in settings where repeated measurements are made on the same statistical units, or where measurements are made on clusters of related statistical units.\n",
    "- **Example:** Teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department to find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a treatment. The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate texts. The random-effects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts. The mixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives.\n",

The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize his or her total value over the period of time considered.[<sup>1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) The name \"multi-armed bandit\" describes a hypothetical experiment where you face several slot machines (\"one-armed bandits\") with potentially different expected payouts. You want to find the slot machine with the best payout rate, but you also want to maximize your winnings. The fundamental tension is between \"exploiting\" arms that have performed well in the past and \"exploring\" new or seemingly inferior arms in case they might perform even better.[<sup>2](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2844870?hl=en)\n",

    "Multiple comparisons is the phenomenon where an apparently statistically significant observation may have actually arisen by chance because of the size of the parameter space to be searched.

As more attributes are compared, it becomes more likely that the treatment and control groups will appear to differ on at least one attribute by random chance alone.\n",

Our confidence that a result will generalize to independent data should generally be weaker if it is observed as part of an analysis that involves multiple comparisons, rather than an analysis that involves only a single comparison.\n",
